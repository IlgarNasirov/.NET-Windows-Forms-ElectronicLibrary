This is an electronic library desktop project. There are admin and user roles. The admins can do all CRUD operations on users, categories and books. The users can look for and rent books. You need to add SQL backup file to your Microsoft SQL Server application for using this project. I used ADO.NET(for connecting database) and Microsoft SQL Server(as a database).
